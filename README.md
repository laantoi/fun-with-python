# fun-with-python

A collection of short projects in Python that were made for fun.

    (1) Logistic Map.ipynb

   Produces the bifurcation diagram of the logistic map.

    (2) DLA.ipynb
    
   Many processes in physics, mathematics, biology and chemistry involve a random walk. In this notebook we demonstrate `Diffusion Limited Aggregation', where a particle undergoes Brownian motion until it collides and aggregates with an existing assembly of the same particles. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion-limited_aggregation
